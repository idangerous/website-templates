<p><strong>LauncherX</strong> is the premium Ajax based countdown template designed by <strong>iDangero.us</strong>. It is designed for temporary usage until the main site is under construction. It comes with an awesome animated clock with a countdown to the grand opening date, brief information about the main site (or company) and Ajax Contact form with validation. Also, there is an opportunity for visitors to leave their email address to be informed when the site will open.</p>
<p>All content is loaded "on the fly" into popup window. Smooth and good looking animation and Ajax features of this template are realized with the JavaScript jQuery library.</p>
